            <p>April 06, 2024, marks the day that we, the Community ALS Implementers of Manolo II along with Manolo I, III and IV have had our first session for the relevant Digital Citizenship empowerment. As its title says, this training aims to empower the Community ALS Implementers through digital literacy which is an integral subject in the Alternative Learning System curriculum.</p>
            <p>I embarked the first session full of excitement and eagerness to gain new knowledge as it is as important for both our learners and us as their teachers.  And indeed, expectation was met. The project organizers and the instructors were all effective and functional. The instructor opened the session with positive curiosity and leave us with new relevant learning. The organizers have provided us conducive environment for learning. As a trainee, I was accommodated well from equipment to food and even emotional accommodation. The instructors and the organizers have been considerate and fair to us when it comes to assessment, time, monitoring and breaks.As the session went on, I have gained new knowledge which I am delighted with because it was practical and very useful especially in my work.</p>
            <p>During the session, one of the most important additional knowledge I have gained was on excel shortcuts on formulas which I was super thankful about since I could use it in making inventories. Another is the topic on creating a simple web page. It was a new learning for me and I found it helpful in promoting myself and the services that I could offer online. It was fascinating that the lesson was multifunctional for media connections as well as business purposes. Though I am still learning the basics of it, I am now excited to share this to my future learners.</p>
            <p>Generally, I reckon my experience in the training as fun, effective, practical and functional. I am super thankful and blessed that I was given this opportunity. May the institution continue to thrive and empower future generation of learners. This journey may end in the campus, but the learning that I gained will continue to blossom and hopefully as well empower my learners in the future.</p>
